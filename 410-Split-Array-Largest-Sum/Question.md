# 410. Split Array Largest Sum

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/)

Given an array which consists of non-negative integers and an integer _m_, you can split the array into _m_ non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these _m_ subarrays.

**Note:**  
Given _m_ satisfies the following constraint: 1 ≤ m ≤ length(nums) ≤ 14,000.

**Examples:**

<pre>Input:
**nums** = [1,2,3,4,5]
**m** = 2

Output:
9

Explanation:
There are four ways to split **nums** into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into **[1,2,3]** and **[4,5]**,
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.
